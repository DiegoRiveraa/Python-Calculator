Project Description:
This is a simple command-line Python calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using Python and provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with. The program ensures valid input and handles errors such as division by zero.

Features:
Supports four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User-friendly interface with menu options for operation selection.
Input validation to prevent invalid entries.
Handles division by zero error gracefully.

1. How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
 git clone https://github.com/DiegoRiveraa/Python-Calculator.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd Python-Calculator

3. Run the program:
   python calaculator.py

Example:
    Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit

Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
5 + 3 = 8.0

Requirements: Python 3.x
Future Improvements: Adding support for more advanced operations like exponentiation, modulus, and square root.
Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
